# Traffic

This is a little Godot project that I made to learn Godot. It just makes a few lines of traffic go by on the with some adjustable values. The intended way to use this is just for fun or to export to a video file and set this as either the login/startup or logout/shutdown sequence but I believe theere is a way to set Godot executables as wallpapers on Windows. This might be very inefficient though.

I intend to add a feature that will ensure that the animation loops so that the video that is exported can be set up as a live wallpaper with any live wallpaper manager that can handle video files but I haven't gotten around to that yet, so stay tuned!

## Thoughts on Godot
Overall my experience with using Godot was very positive. It's a sleek little engine that seems to be able to do it all. It's very easy to do a lot of things without writing any code at all, one of the things that I think is also its downfall. With being able to set attributs in a bunch of different places you end up setting them somewhere and not knowing where that might be. Furthermore, while the scripting and GUI stuff are pretty tightly linked I still think that it would be better to encourage one more stongly while in reality you are effectively forced to use both. As pointed out by some others, the concept of scene inheritance is a little half-baked. I think that it does work pretty well but could be improved especially in the GUI.

The engine has some quirks that make it a little unintuitive to pick up sometimes but its nothing major and you learn to work around it. 

I do wish that there was automatic history tracking and I didn't have to lose my data when it crashed once or when I stupidly overwrote something but I probably should have been using git so whatever.
